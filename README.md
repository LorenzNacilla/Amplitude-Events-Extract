# Amplitude-Events-Extract

This repo looks into extracting events data from the Amplitude API. There were two methods in calling the API - one using airbyte to call the API itself and then landing it in an azure blob storage, and the other with a python script. This repo mainly contains the python script to call the API but the method with airbyte and azure blob storage is used.
